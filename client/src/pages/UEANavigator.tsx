                  Persistent Left Superior Vena Cava (PLSVC) is the most common congenital thoracic venous anomaly, occurring in 0.3–0.5% of the general population and 4–8% of patients with congenital heart disease. The left SVC persists from embryonic development and typically drains into the right atrium via a dilated coronary sinus. It is usually an incidental finding but has important implications for pacemaker implantation, central line placement, and cardiac surgery.
