              <strong>Key principle:</strong> Agitated saline microbubbles (50–200 µm) are too large to cross normal pulmonary capillaries. Appearance in the left heart ≤3 cardiac cycles after RV opacification = intracardiac R-to-L shunt (PFO/ASD). Appearance after 3–5 cycles = intrapulmonary shunt. Early coronary sinus opacification on left arm injection = PLSVC.

                Definity (perflutren lipid microspheres) and Lumason (sulfur hexafluoride lipid-type A microspheres) both contain polyethylene glycol (PEG) as a component of their lipid shell. Patients with known PEG hypersensitivity — including those with prior reactions to PEGylated medications, certain laxatives (MiraLAX), or COVID-19 mRNA vaccines — may be at increased risk for hypersensitivity reactions. Optison does not contain PEG and may be a safer alternative in PEG-sensitive patients.
