    description: "Diastolic stress echo uses exercise to unmask elevated filling pressures in patients with exertional dyspnoea and preserved EF. A post-exercise E/e' >14 or TR Vmax >2.8 m/s strongly supports HFpEF.",
    howToGet: [
      "Acquire rest A4C with MV PW Doppler and TDI (septal and lateral e')",
      "Perform semi-supine bicycle exercise to 50–75W or symptom-limited",
      "Immediately post-exercise: acquire MV PW Doppler and TDI",
      "Acquire TR CW Doppler within 1–2 minutes of stopping exercise",

    tips: [
      "Post-exercise E/e' >14 = elevated LAP — supports HFpEF diagnosis",
      "Post-exercise TR Vmax >2.8 m/s = elevated RVSP — supports HFpEF",
      "Both criteria positive = high specificity for HFpEF",
      "Acquire Doppler immediately — values normalise within 3–5 minutes",
    ],
    pitfalls: [
      "Tachycardia fuses E and A waves — use longer DT to separate",
      "Lateral e' is more variable — use average of septal and lateral",
